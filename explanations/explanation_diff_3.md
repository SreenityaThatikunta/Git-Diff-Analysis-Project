# Explanation of Password Generation Code

This document provides a beginner-friendly explanation of the C code provided in the git diff, focusing on how the password generation works.

## Overview

The code implements a program that:

1.  **Checks user-provided password:**
    *   Ensures it's 10 characters long and doesn't contain certain special characters.
    *   Calculates and displays password strength based on character variety.
2.  **Generates a random 10-character password:**
    *   If the user's password is not strong enough or if the user chooses to generate a password, the program generates a strong, random password.

## Code Breakdown

### 1. Header Includes

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>
```

*   **`stdio.h`**: Standard input/output library for functions like `printf` (printing to the console) and `scanf` (reading from the console).
*   **`string.h`**: String manipulation library, containing functions like `strlen` (calculating string length) and `strchr` (locating characters in a string).
*   **`stdlib.h`**: Standard library, which includes general-purpose functions, like `rand` (generating random numbers), `srand` (seeding random number generator), and `system`.
*   **`time.h`**: Time library, which provides functions for dealing with time such as `time`, used for creating a random number seed.

### 2. `swap` function

```c
void swap (char *p1, char*p2)
{
    char temp = *p1;
    *p1 = *p2;
    *p2 = temp;
}
```
*   This function takes two character pointers as input and swaps the characters they point to. It uses a temporary variable `temp` for this swapping process.

### 3. `shuffle` function
```c
void shuffle(char *arr, int n)
{
    srand((unsigned int)(time(NULL)));
    int i;
    for (i = n - 1; i > 0; i--)
    {
        int j = rand() % (i + 1);
        swap(&arr[i], &arr[j]);
    }
}
```
*   This function takes a character array `arr` and its size `n` as input.
*   It shuffles the characters of the array in random order.
*   It does this by iterating through the array from end to start, and for each element, it generates a random index `j` and swaps the current element with the element at the randomly generated index `j`.
*   `srand((unsigned int)(time(NULL)))` is used to seed the random number generator which makes sure a different random order each time the program is run.

### 4. `generate_password` Function
```c
void generate_password()
{ 
    //creating arrays for different sets of characters
    char numbers[] = "0123456789"; 
    char lower_case[] = "abcdefghijklmnoqprstuvwyzx"; 
    char upper_case[] = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOQPRSTUYWVZX"; 
    char special_char1[] = "?-+=";
    char special_char2[] = "!@#$";
    char password[11]; //to store the generated password, 11 to hold null terminating char
    
    //picking 2 characters from each of the character sets
    for (int i=0; i<2; i++)
    {
        password[i] = numbers[rand()%strlen(numbers)];
    }
    for (int i=2; i<4; i++)
    {
        password[i] = lower_case[rand()%strlen(lower_case)];
    }
     for (int i=4; i<6; i++)
    {
        password[i] = upper_case[rand()%strlen(upper_case)];
    }
    for (int i=6; i<8; i++)
    {
        password[i] = special_char1[rand()%strlen(special_char1)];
    }
    for (int i=8; i<10; i++)
    {
        password[i] = special_char2[rand()%strlen(special_char2)];
    }
    password[10] = '\0'; // adding null terminating character
    shuffle(password,10); // calling shuffle function to randomly shuffle all the characters in the array
    printf("\n The suggested password is: %s", password);
}
```

*   This function generates a strong random password by:
    *   **Defining character sets:** It creates arrays for numbers, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and two sets of special characters.
    *   **Selecting characters:** It picks two random characters from each of the character sets.
    *  **Shuffling characters**: It then calls the shuffle function to randomly mix the selected characters.
    *   **Outputting password:** It prints the generated password to the console.

### 5. `main` Function

```c
int main()
{
    system("cls");                   // used to clear the screen each time the program is run
    char user_password[100];
    printf("\n This program will tell the strength of your password, and also suggest a randomly generated 100%% strength password. ");
    
    //labelled as repeat
    repeat: printf("\n The password should not contain the following characters:");
    printf("\n '_', '/', '*', '%%', '&', '\', ';', '|', '~'.");
    printf("\n The password should contain exactly 10 characters.");   
    printf("\n Enter your password: ");
    scanf("%s", user_password);
    if(strlen(user_password)!=10)
    {
        printf("\n Password should be 10 characters long.\n\n");
        goto repeat;    //restart from the label 'repeat'
    }
    
    if(strchr(user_password, '_')!=NULL||strchr(user_password, '/')!=NULL||strchr(user_password, '*')!=NULL||strchr(user_password, '%')!=NULL||strchr(user_password, '&')!=NULL||strchr(user_password, '\\')!=NULL||strchr(user_password, ';')!=NULL||strchr(user_password, '|')!=NULL||strchr(user_password, '~')!=NULL)
    {
            printf("\n Please remove the forbidden characters from the password and try again.\n\n");
           goto repeat;
    }
    
    int lower_case = 0, upper_case = 0, numbers = 0, special_char = 0;
    for(int i=0; i<strlen(user_password); i++)
    {
        if(user_password[i]>='a' && user_password[i]<='z') lower_case=1;
        else if(user_password[i]>='A' && user_password[i]<='Z') upper_case=1;
        else if(user_password[i]>='0' && user_password[i]<='9') numbers=1;
        else special_char=1;
    }
    int password_strength = lower_case+upper_case+numbers+special_char;
    
    printf("\n Strength of the password: %d/4", password_strength);
    if(password_strength!=4)
        printf("\n Your password is not 100%% strong.");
    else printf("\n Your password is 100%% strong.");
    
    char choice;
    printf("\n Do you want to generate a password? (y/n): ");
    scanf(" %c", &choice);
    if(choice=='y')
    {
        srand((unsigned int)(time(NULL))); 
        generate_password();
    }  
    printf("\n");
    return 0; 
}
```

*   **Clears the screen**: It clears the console using `system("cls")`.
*   **Prompts for password**: It prompts the user to enter a password.
*   **Password Length check**: The program checks the length of the entered password if it is not 10 it asks the user to enter a password again. This is done using the `goto repeat;` statement.
*   **Forbidden character check**: Checks if the password contains any of the forbidden characters.
*   **Password strength check**: The program then iterates through each character in the password and checks if it contains a lower case character, an upper case character, a digit and a special character. Each unique kind of character makes the password strong. Based on this the strength of the password is displayed.
*   **Generate password**: Asks the user if they want a password to be generated for them. If the user inputs `y` then a 10 character strong password is generated.

## Key Concepts

*   **Random Number Generation:** The code uses `rand()` and `srand()` to generate random characters for the password. `srand(time(NULL))` ensures that the sequence of random numbers is different each time the program runs.
*   **String Manipulation:** `strlen()` calculates the length of a string, `strchr()` finds the presence of a character in a string.
*   **Arrays:** Character arrays (strings) are used to store character sets and the generated password.
*   **Pointers**: Used in swap function for swapping the characters of a character array
*   **Functions:** The code is organized into functions (`swap`, `shuffle`, `generate_password`) for better readability and reusability.
*   **`goto` statement:** The `goto` statement allows the program to jump to a specific label in the code. This statement is used to repeatedly prompt for a password when the user enters a password not meeting the requirements of length of the password. It is generally not good practice to use `goto` statements as it reduces the readability of the code.
*   **ASCII Values**: The program compares the input characters with ASCII values to determine the type of character, for example, if the character's ASCII value is between that of 'a' and 'z' then it is said to be a lower case character.

## Summary

This C code generates and evaluates passwords. It ensures that user-entered passwords are of the correct length and do not contain specific characters. It also assesses password strength and offers to generate a random, robust password. The program is useful for teaching basic concepts of string manipulation, random numbers generation and conditional statements.
